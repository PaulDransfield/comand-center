# AI Scheduling — architecture + build plan

> Drafted 2026-05-25 after the user requested a deeper take on bringing back the AI-recommended schedule. Companion mockup at `cc_ai_recommended_schedule_en.html`. **Plan only — not yet implemented.** Revisit when the inventory-pipeline shipping work cools and the second multi-site customer onboarding is in sight.

---

## 1. What this delivers

A `/scheduling` page that:

- **Pulls the actual roster from Personalkollen** into a weekly grid (rows = staff, columns = days, cells = planned shifts).
- **Shows per-day demand context** alongside the schedule: forecast revenue, planned cost, planned hours, projected staff %, weather, holidays.
- **Surfaces AI-recommended changes inline** — per-shift suggestions (cut this shift, add an open shift here, move someone from Tuesday to Friday) with reasoning and SEK impact.
- **Lets the owner approve or override** each suggestion individually, then writes the accepted changes back to Personalkollen so the source of truth stays in PK.
- **Learns from owner overrides** the same way the bulk-review AI does — recent owner corrections become in-context examples for the next AI run.

The page is **advisory-first**. The AI never writes to PK without the owner clicking "Apply." Phase 1 ships read-only insight. Phase 2 adds the write-back. Phase 3 adds AI-builds-the-week.

---

## 2. UX summary (from the mockup)

Key elements from `cc_ai_recommended_schedule_en.html` informing the build:

| Element | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Top banner** | "AI recommends N changes save X kr this week" — owner-visible value framing, with "Generate suggestion" CTA |
| **Day column header** | Date, weather icon, forecast revenue, planned hours, projected staff % chip |
| **Section group header** | Management / Front of House / Kitchen / Bar — collapsible, shows section totals |
| **Recommended-staff row** | Under each section header: AI's suggested headcount per day for THAT section |
| **Staff row** | Avatar + name, per-day shift cells |
| **Planned shift cell** | Striped lavender background = scheduled in PK with role + start-end times |
| **AI suggestion cell** | Dashed orange border = AI proposes adding/modifying this shift, not yet in PK |
| **Time-off cell** | Solid blue = approved time off |
| **Open shift placeholder** | Dashed lavender outline "+ Open shift" — empty slot the AI thinks needs filling |
| **Footer legend** + **"Apply & send to Personalkollen"** | Apply approved suggestions and push back to PK |

Decision implicit in the mockup: **the AI is allowed to recommend ADDING shifts, not just cutting.** This is a deliberate departure from the current `SCHEDULING_ASYMMETRY` rule (`lib/ai/rules.ts`). See §7.

### 2.1 Pre-publish review (new requirement, locked 2026-05-25)

Before the owner clicks "Apply & send to Personalkollen", a review panel surfaces four KPI views so they can sanity-check the week. The owner can return to the grid and tweak any individual cell, then re-open the review. **Apply** is disabled while any HARD compliance check is failing.

**1. Forecast vs hours** — per-day stacked chart. Bar = planned hours (broken down by section: kitchen/foh/bar/management). Line overlay = forecast revenue. Owner spots over- or under-staffed days relative to expected demand at a glance. Two badges per day: a delta-from-target-pct chip (green if within ±2%, amber outside) and a "vs last similar week" comparator.

**2. Cost of labour %** — weekly headline number with per-day breakdown. Shows: planned labour cost (SEK), forecast revenue (SEK), planned %, target %, gap. Sparkline of the last 8 same-weekday weeks for context. Per-day cells show whether the day's planned % is within target or breaching.

**3. Staff per hour vs demand** — 24-hour bar chart per day showing scheduled headcount per hour (one bar per section colour) overlaid against an expected-demand curve (forecasted covers / transactions / revenue, derived from historical day-of-week patterns). Highlights under-covered peaks (lunch rush at 12-13, dinner peak at 19-21) and over-staffed troughs (15-17 typical mid-afternoon lull).

**4. Compliance checks** — pass/warn/fail list of Swedish labour-law + business-rule constraints applied to the proposed schedule:

| Check | Threshold | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Min rest between shifts | ≥11h (Arbetstidslagen) | HARD — blocks Apply |
| Max consecutive working days | ≤6 days | HARD |
| Max weekly hours per staff | ≤contracted_max OR 48h (EU directive) | HARD |
| Daily rest in 24h period | ≥11h continuous | HARD |
| Weekly rest period | ≥36h continuous in 7 days | WARN |
| Break compliance | ≥30 min break for >6h shift | WARN |
| Contracted-hours floor | Don't schedule a 50%-contract person at <40% of contract | WARN |
| Unavailable days | Staff hasn't blocked this day | WARN |
| Lone-closer policy | If owner has enabled "two-person close required", flag single closes | WARN |
| Minor employees | <18yo can't work after 22:00 or split shifts | HARD (only if business has any) |

Hard failures show inline on the offending cell in the grid AND block the Apply button until resolved. Warns can be acknowledged with one click ("I know, apply anyway") and the acknowledgement is logged.

The review panel is a slide-up sheet (or right-rail panel) that doesn't navigate away from the grid — the owner stays in editing context. Closing the review returns them to the grid with any unresolved warnings highlighted on the affected cells.

## 3. Data architecture

### 3.1 What PK gives us (verify during Phase 0 probe)

We currently capture, per shift (`staff_logs` table):
- staff_uid, shift_date, scheduled vs logged signature, work_time net of breaks, estimated_salary, sale_center

We probably DO NOT yet capture (but PK likely exposes):
- **Shift start + end times** (we have totals but not the time window)
- **Position / role** per shift (server, chef, bartender, supervisor)
- **Section / department** at shift-level granularity
- **Break length** per shift
- **Shift type** (regular, open, holiday, sick, requested-off)

We almost certainly don't capture:
- **Staff contracts** — full-time vs part-time, max hours/week, contracted minimum
- **Availability** — days/times the staff member is willing to work
- **Position assignments at hire time** (vs at shift time)

**Phase 0 must include**: probe PK's API surface to map exactly which endpoints expose what. Start from `lib/pos/personalkollen.ts` and the `feedback_pk_api_gotchas` memory. Probably 4-6 hours of poking + writing a `scripts/probe-pk-schedule-api.mjs`.

### 3.2 New tables to add

**`staff_profiles`** — one row per staff per business, refreshed nightly from PK + derived patterns:

```sql
staff_profiles (
  staff_uid, business_id, org_id,
  display_name, full_name, email,
  primary_position TEXT,             -- 'server' | 'chef' | 'bartender' | 'supervisor' | 'gm'
  primary_section TEXT,              -- 'foh' | 'kitchen' | 'bar' | 'management'
  contract_type TEXT,                -- 'full_time' | 'part_time' | 'hourly' | 'visstid'
  contracted_hours_per_week NUMERIC, -- nullable
  hourly_rate_sek NUMERIC,
  ob_eligible BOOLEAN,
  hired_at DATE,
  -- Derived from observed shift history (refreshed nightly):
  typical_days JSONB,                -- { mon: 0.9, tue: 0.1, wed: 0.0, ... } 12-week trailing
  typical_shift_window TEXT,         -- 'opener' | 'midday' | 'closer' | 'split'
  versatility_score NUMERIC,         -- 0-1, fraction of total sections worked
  punctuality_score NUMERIC,         -- 0-1, scheduled-start vs logged-start agreement
  no_show_rate NUMERIC,              -- 0-1 over last 90 days
  last_refreshed_at TIMESTAMPTZ
)
```

**`staff_shifts`** — per-shift detail beyond what `staff_logs` aggregates (only added if PK has the data):

```sql
staff_shifts (
  id, business_id, staff_uid, shift_date,
  start_time TIMESTAMPTZ, end_time TIMESTAMPTZ,
  position TEXT, section TEXT,
  break_minutes INTEGER,
  shift_type TEXT,                   -- 'regular' | 'open' | 'on_call' | 'holiday' | 'sick'
  pk_shift_id TEXT,                  -- PK's stable id for write-back idempotency
  is_ai_suggested BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  ai_suggestion_id UUID REFERENCES schedule_ai_suggestions(id),
  applied_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  applied_by UUID,                   -- user_id of owner who clicked Apply
  source TEXT,                       -- 'pk_sync' | 'ai_generated' | 'manual_override'
  raw_data JSONB,
  ...
)
```

**`schedule_ai_suggestions`** — one row per AI-recommended change:

```sql
schedule_ai_suggestions (
  id, business_id, week_iso,
  staff_uid, shift_date,
  action TEXT,                       -- 'cut' | 'add' | 'reduce' | 'extend' | 'reassign'
  before JSONB,                      -- what's currently planned
  proposed JSONB,                    -- what AI suggests
  reasoning TEXT,
  est_sek_saving NUMERIC,
  confidence NUMERIC,
  status TEXT,                       -- 'pending' | 'applied' | 'rejected' | 'expired'
  applied_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  rejected_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  rejected_reason TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  ai_model TEXT, tokens_input INTEGER, tokens_output INTEGER
)
```

**`staff_performance_signals`** — owner-supplied micro-ratings (Phase 3):

```sql
staff_performance_signals (
  id, business_id, staff_uid,
  dimension TEXT,                    -- 'closer_confidence' | 'rush_capability' | 'section_fit' | 'demand_pull'
  score INTEGER,                     -- typically 1-5
  shift_id UUID REFERENCES staff_shifts(id) NULL,
  notes TEXT,                        -- optional, owner-typed
  source TEXT,                       -- 'post_shift_prompt' | 'weekly_review' | 'manual'
  recorded_at TIMESTAMPTZ, recorded_by UUID
)
```

### 3.3 The AI input contract

The scheduling AI receives a single context payload assembled by `lib/ai/scheduling-context.ts`:

```typescript
{
  business:        { id, name, country, opening_days, cost_targets, business_stage }
  week:            { iso: '2026-W22', from: 'Mon', to: 'Sun' }
  demand_forecast: per_day_revenue, per_day_covers, weather, holidays
  current_schedule: per_day_shifts[] from staff_shifts
  staff:           profiles[] (typical_days, versatility, rates, performance signals)
  history:         last_12_weeks_planned_vs_actual cost %
  rules:           { target_staff_pct, allow_ai_adds: boolean, max_consecutive_days, ... }
  recent_overrides: last 30 days of `schedule_ai_suggestions` where status=rejected — LEARN
}
```

AI returns `schedule_ai_suggestions` rows. UI shows them inline. Owner clicks Apply per-suggestion OR Apply-all. Applied suggestions write to PK + insert into `staff_shifts` with `is_ai_suggested=true`.

---

## 4. Build phases

### Phase 0 — PK API discovery (½ day)

- Probe `personalkollen.se`'s API for: per-shift detail endpoint (start/end/position/section), staff contracts endpoint, availability endpoint, write-back endpoints
- Document what's available vs not in this file
- Decision gate: if PK doesn't expose enough metadata, Phase 2 reduces in scope (we can still display + recommend, just less granular)

### Phase 1 — Grid display + insight overlay (2 days)

Goal: owner can see "this is what's planned this week, here's where we'll land cost-wise, here's what the AI thinks."

- Schema: `staff_profiles` (with auto-refresh cron) + `staff_shifts` if PK exposes detail
- PK sync extension: pull schedule for current + next week into `staff_shifts`, refresh `staff_profiles.typical_*` fields nightly
- API: `GET /api/scheduling/week?business_id=&week=YYYY-Www` returns the full grid payload
- UI: `/scheduling` page implementing the mockup, **without** the AI suggestion overlay (no orange dashed cells yet) — show planned shifts, section groupings, per-day totals
- AI insight banner: read existing `/api/scheduling/ai-suggestion` recommendations, surface "Project N% staff cost this week" + "Y kr above target" at the top

### Phase 2 — AI suggestions inline + pre-publish review + apply-back (4 days)

- Schema: `schedule_ai_suggestions`
- New endpoint `POST /api/scheduling/ai-recommend` — runs the planner, writes suggestion rows, returns them
- UI: render suggestions as the orange dashed cells in the mockup. Per-cell **Approve / Modify / Reject** controls (NEVER auto-apply). Modify opens an inline editor for shift time/role/staff swap. Bulk "Apply all approved" at the bottom applies only the cells the owner has explicitly approved.
- **Pre-publish review panel** (§2.1): a slide-up sheet that runs before Apply. Four KPI tabs (Forecast vs hours / Cost of labour % / Staff per hour vs demand / Compliance checks). HARD compliance failures disable the Apply button until resolved; WARNs are one-click-acknowledgeable. Owner can flip back to grid to fix anything, then re-open review.
- **Compliance engine** (`lib/scheduling/compliance.ts`) — pure-compute checks against Arbetstidslagen + EU directives + business-config rules. Single function takes `{ shifts, staff_profiles, business_rules }` returns `{ checks: [{severity, code, message, affected_shift_ids}] }`. Same engine powers both the review panel AND inline cell warnings on the grid.
- **Hourly-coverage chart** — derive expected demand from existing forecast endpoint's hourly breakdown (`/api/scheduling/ai-suggestion` already has per-day; needs extension to per-hour if not already there).
- PK write-back (`lib/pos/personalkollen-write.ts`): only if PK has a write API. If not, "Apply" updates `staff_shifts` locally + opens PK in a new tab with copy-paste-ready instructions.
- Learning loop: every Approve/Modify/Reject inserts into the suggestion row's status + records owner reasoning for next AI run. Modifications are particularly valuable signal — they show what the AI got CLOSE but not RIGHT. Acknowledged WARNs also feed back (owner consistently acks "lone closer" → AI stops flagging it for that business).

### Phase 3 — Performance signals (1-2 days)

- Schema: `staff_performance_signals`
- Surgical UI prompts:
  - **After each close**: card on dashboard "Was [Closer] the right choice for tonight?" → quick rating
  - **End of week**: "Any staff that customers asked for by name?" → multi-select
  - **First time someone covers new section**: "Should [Name] become regular in [Section]?" → yes/maybe/no
- Feed scores into `staff_profiles` aggregated metrics (e.g., `closer_confidence: 0.87`)
- Scheduling AI's prompt gets a "Owner-validated strengths" block per staff

### Phase 4 — AI builds the week from scratch (3-5 days)

- New endpoint `POST /api/scheduling/ai-generate` — given empty week + constraints, AI produces the full schedule
- Constraints input UI: target staff %, mandatory minimum coverage per section, who's off, who can't work which days
- Generation returns a full set of `schedule_ai_suggestions` with `action='add'` for every shift
- Owner reviews, tweaks per-cell, applies

---

## 5. AI design

### Model + cost

- **Sonnet 4.6** with extended thinking — scheduling is genuinely a reasoning task, not classification. Worth the cost.
- Estimated cost per generation: ~$0.20 per week per business (rich context, ~30k input tokens with prompt cache)
- Prompt cache the staff profiles + business rules; only the variable week-specific data isn't cached

### Asymmetric rule revision

Current `SCHEDULING_ASYMMETRY` rule says "cuts only, never adds." Phase 2 onward needs to revisit this:

- **Recommendation:** keep cuts as the AI's default behavior, but allow adds when ALL of:
  - Forecast revenue is meaningfully above the trailing 12-week median
  - At least one day of similar forecast in the last 8 weeks ran above target labour %
  - The added shift is within an existing staff member's typical_days pattern (low commitment risk)
  - Owner has opted in via a settings toggle (default off)
- **NEW rule for the AI:** for every "add" suggestion, the AI MUST quantify the downside — what's the cash burn if revenue doesn't materialise? Owner sees this in the suggestion banner.

This goes into `lib/ai/rules.ts` as `SCHEDULING_ASYMMETRIC_V2` and the owner-toggle lives on `businesses.scheduling_ai_allow_adds`.

### Learning loop

Same pattern as the inventory bulk-review AI:
- Every Reject inserts into `schedule_ai_suggestions` with reasoning
- Next generation reads the last 30 days of rejections as in-context examples ("AI suggested X but owner rejected because Y — LEARN")
- Over time the AI's suggestions tighten to the owner's actual preferences

### Calibration

Track per-business "AI suggestion accept rate" — if it dips below 50% the AI is generating noise, surface a "AI is wrong too often, want to retune?" admin alert.

---

## 6. PK write-back — feasibility unknowns

The riskiest unknown for the whole plan. Two scenarios:

**A. PK has a documented write API.** Best case. We POST shift changes, PK accepts, our `staff_shifts.applied_at` records the round-trip.

**B. PK is read-only for third parties.** Likely. Then Phase 2's "Apply" button:
- Updates our `staff_shifts` table locally (so the AI sees the applied state next time)
- Generates a clipboard-friendly text summary ("Tuesday: schedule Anna 11:00-15:00 as server")
- Opens PK in a new tab pointed at the right week
- Owner manually applies in PK — sync picks it up on next nightly pull

Phase 0 must answer this before Phase 2 design is finalised. Memory note: the `project_pk_contracts_parked` memo says "Probe PK API for un-wired endpoints when revisited" — that's now.

---

## 7. Performance scoring — guardrails

Sweden has strict employment-law rules around documenting staff performance. The scoring system must be:

- **Explicitly scoped as a scheduling tool, not an HR tool.** UI copy says "This helps the AI schedule you better — it doesn't go in employee records."
- **Aggregated only.** Owner never sees a single owner-supplied rating attributed to a specific shift in a way that could be used to build a "performance file."
- **Time-windowed.** Scores older than 6 months don't influence the AI. Avoids permanent records of one bad shift.
- **Owner-only inputs.** Not collaborative — no other staff or managers leaving comments about a colleague.
- **No firing/raise integration.** The scores never appear in the upgrade flow or any HR-adjacent surface.

Worth a 30-minute review by someone with Swedish-employment-law context before Phase 3 launches. The risk isn't catastrophic but it's avoidable.

---

## 8. Risks + open questions

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **PK write API doesn't exist** | Phase 2 fallback: clipboard-friendly export + manual PK update |
| **AI suggests adds that owner rejects every time** | Track accept rate; if <50% disable adds for that business |
| **Staff profiles drift** when someone changes roles | Nightly refresh from PK + 12-week pattern window means it self-corrects in 2-3 weeks |
| **Performance scoring becomes an HR document** | Strict legal review + UI copy + 6-month decay |
| **Owners game the schedule** to pretend they hit target | Compare planned vs actual labour cost from PK — surface gap on dashboard |
| **AI doesn't account for skills the owner knows but hasn't rated** | Phase 3 performance prompts only ask for what's actionable; owner can always manually override the AI |
| **Cost runaway from AI calls** | Per-week generations cached 24h server-side; bulk regen capped to 1×/day per business |

### Open questions for the owner

1. **Where does the weekly target staff % come from?** Existing `businesses.target_staff_pct`, or weekly-adjustable on this page, or AI-derived from revenue forecast?
2. ~~**Approval model.**~~ **RESOLVED 2026-05-25:** AI always suggests, owner reviews + approves OR modifies before apply. Never auto-apply, never apply without owner pass. Both per-cell tweaks and "Apply all approved" available. The owner stays in control of every shift change that goes back to PK.
3. **Edit history.** When owner overrides AI's suggestion with their own change, is that change written back to PK? Or just to our `staff_shifts` for AI's next round of learning?
4. **Multi-business scope.** Do AI suggestions cross business boundaries (e.g., move someone from Vero to Chicce for one shift)? Almost certainly NO — separate Fortnox orgs make this messy — but worth confirming.
5. **Suggestion expiry.** A suggestion made on Monday for next Tuesday should expire by Tuesday morning — that's fine. But what about suggestions made for the current week as the week progresses?

---

## 9. Recommended sequencing

Real-world build order I'd recommend:

1. **Phase 0** — PK API probe (4-6 hours)
2. **Phase 1** — Grid + insight banner (2 days, ships immediately useful work)
3. **Customer feedback** — show Chicce + Vero, see if they actually use it before building further
4. **Phase 3** — Performance signals FIRST (before Phase 2), because:
   - Owner gets value with no AI noise risk
   - Builds the dataset needed for high-quality AI later
   - Tests whether owners will actually rate consistently
5. **Phase 2** — AI suggestions inline + apply-back
6. **Phase 4** — AI builds full week

Reversing 2 and 3 is the key non-obvious sequencing call. The AI suggestions are only as good as the data underneath them; build the data first.

**Effort total:** ~9-11 days for everything (Phase 2 grew by ~1 day to absorb the compliance engine + pre-publish review panel). Easy to ship Phase 1 + Phase 3 in a single week (~3-4 days) and let those bake before committing to the heavier write-back + review work.

---

## 10. Dependencies / parallel work

- **Variance loop** (M097, just shipped) — separate but the pattern matters: performance scoring → AI input pipeline is parallel to POS sales → variance calc, same architecture style.
- **Fortnox cache** (M098) — independent, no shared work.
- **Holiday module** — already powers OverviewChart red weekend labels; just reuse `getHolidaysForCountry()` for the day-header weather/holiday icons.

---

## 11. What we're NOT building

Explicit out-of-scope so we don't bloat:

- Shift swapping between staff (PK handles this; we don't try to replicate)
- Time-off request workflow (PK)
- Payroll calculations (PK + Fortnox)
- Multi-week future planning beyond 2 weeks (the AI's signal degrades fast past 2 weeks)
- Mobile app (web-responsive is enough for owner use; staff use PK's app)
- Staff-facing views (owner-only tool; staff continue using PK)

---

## 12. Open file references

- `cc_ai_recommended_schedule_en.html` — UI mockup
- `lib/pos/personalkollen.ts` — PK sync code (existing)
- `lib/ai/rules.ts` — scheduling asymmetry rule + benchmarks (will be revised)
- `lib/sync/aggregate.ts` — staff_logs aggregation (will be cross-referenced)
- `app/api/scheduling/ai-suggestion/route.ts` — existing weekly cron endpoint (will evolve)
- Memory: `project_pk_contracts_parked.md`, `feedback_scheduling_asymmetric.md`, `feedback_pk_api_gotchas.md`
